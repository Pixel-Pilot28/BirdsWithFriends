# Feature 5 - Serialized Scheduling Implementation Summary

## Overview

Feature 5 has been fully implemented to allow multi-episode stories to be created and released on a scheduled basis (daily/weekly). This enables the "serialized" story experience where episodes are automatically published over time rather than all at once.

## Implementation Details

### ✅ 1. Story Scheduling Data Model

**Database Schema Updates** (`story_engine/database.py`):
- `stories.total_episodes` - Number of planned episodes
- `stories.start_date` - When to begin releasing episodes  
- `stories.release_frequency` - "daily", "weekly", or "custom"
- `stories.timezone` - User's timezone for scheduling
- `stories.next_release_at` - Next scheduled episode release time
- `stories.is_serialized` - Boolean flag for serialized vs immediate release
- `episodes.scheduled_for` - When a specific episode is scheduled for release

**Pydantic Models** (`story_engine/models/__init__.py`):
- `StoryScheduleRequest` - Request model for setting up schedules
- `ScheduleStatus` - Response model for schedule information  
- `ReleaseFrequency` enum - Daily/weekly/custom options
- Updated `StoryRequest` to include optional scheduling fields

### ✅ 2. Scheduler Backend (APScheduler Implementation)

**Core Scheduler** (`story_engine/scheduler.py`):
- **Technology**: APScheduler with Redis persistence
- **Job Store**: Redis-backed for persistence across restarts
- **Executors**: AsyncIO-based for FastAPI compatibility
- **Features**:
  - Automatic job recovery on restart
  - Event listeners for job monitoring
  - Timezone-aware scheduling
  - Configurable retry delays and grace periods

**Key Methods**:
- `schedule_story_episodes()` - Sets up all episode release jobs
- `_publish_episode()` - Publishes individual episodes
- `cancel_story_schedule()` - Cancels all scheduled releases
- `_reschedule_existing_stories()` - Recovers schedules after restarts

### ✅ 3. User Control API Endpoints

**New REST Endpoints** (`story_engine/service.py`):

#### POST `/stories/{story_id}/schedule`
Set up serialized release schedule for an existing story.
```json
{
  "story_id": "uuid",
  "start_date": "2024-01-20T09:00:00Z",
  "release_frequency": "daily",
  "timezone": "America/New_York"
}
```

#### GET `/stories/{story_id}/schedule`  
Get current schedule status and next release information.

#### DELETE `/stories/{story_id}/schedule`
Cancel scheduled releases (episodes revert to draft status).

#### GET `/scheduler/status`
Monitor scheduler health and view active jobs.

**Enhanced Story Creation**:
- `POST /stories` now accepts optional `schedule` parameter
- Supports both immediate and scheduled story creation
- Automatically generates all episodes for scheduled stories

### ✅ 4. Idempotency & Retry Logic

**Database Transactional Locks**:
```python
episode = db.query(Episode).filter(
    and_(
        Episode.story_id == story_id,
        Episode.episode_index == episode_index,
        Episode.status == EpisodeStatus.SCHEDULED.value
    )
).with_for_update().first()  # Prevents concurrent publishing
```

**Retry Mechanism**:
- Failed episode publications automatically retry after 1 hour
- Unique job IDs prevent duplicate scheduling
- Graceful handling of database connection failures
- Status transitions ensure episodes can't be published twice

**APScheduler Configuration**:
- `coalesce: True` - Combines multiple pending executions
- `max_instances: 1` - Prevents multiple instances of same job
- `misfire_grace_time: 300` - 5-minute grace period for delayed jobs

## Usage Examples

### 1. Create Immediate Story (Original Behavior)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/stories" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "story_request": {
      "user_id": "user123",
      "episodes": 3,
      # ... other story data
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Create Scheduled Story (New Feature)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/stories" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "story_request": {
      "user_id": "user123", 
      "episodes": 5,
      # ... other story data
    },
    "schedule": {
      "start_date": "2024-01-20T09:00:00Z",
      "release_frequency": "daily",
      "timezone": "America/New_York"
    }
  }'
```

### 3. Schedule Existing Story
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8005/stories/story-uuid/schedule" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "story_id": "story-uuid",
    "start_date": "2024-01-21T10:00:00Z", 
    "release_frequency": "weekly",
    "timezone": "UTC"
  }'
```

### 4. Check Schedule Status
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8005/stories/story-uuid/schedule"
```

### 5. Cancel Schedule
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8005/stories/story-uuid/schedule"
```

## Service Integration

### Startup/Shutdown Lifecycle
- Scheduler automatically starts when FastAPI service starts
- Recovers existing scheduled jobs from Redis on restart
- Graceful shutdown prevents job interruption
- Health check endpoint includes scheduler status

### Background Task Coordination
- Episode generation and scheduling work together seamlessly  
- Stories can be created and scheduled simultaneously
- Automatic setup of schedules after episode generation completes
- Configurable timeouts prevent indefinite waiting

### Dependencies Added
```
apscheduler==3.10.4
pytz==2023.3
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been created (`test_story_scheduling.py`) covering:
- Story creation with and without scheduling
- Schedule setup and cancellation
- API endpoint functionality
- Scheduler status monitoring
- Error handling and edge cases

## Notification Integration Points

The scheduler includes hooks for notification services:
- `_send_episode_notification()` method called after each publication
- Ready for integration with push notifications, email, social media
- Structured logging for monitoring and analytics
- Event-driven architecture for extensibility

## Production Considerations

### Redis Configuration
- Persistent Redis instance required for job storage
- Recommended: Redis with RDB and AOF persistence enabled
- Connection pooling and retry logic built-in

### Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging throughout scheduler operations
- Job execution events and error tracking
- Health check endpoint for service monitoring
- Metrics collection points for dashboard integration

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling supported through Redis job store
- Single scheduler instance prevents duplicate job execution
- Configurable job limits and resource constraints
- Database connection pooling for high-throughput scenarios
