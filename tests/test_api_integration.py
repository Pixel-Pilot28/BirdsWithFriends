"""
Integration tests for Backend API Feature 7.

Tests the complete flow across services:
1. Trigger sample capture via /ingest/sample
2. Send recognition events via /recognize  
3. Get aggregated summaries via /aggregator/summary
4. Manage characters and users

Also includes original recognition service integration tests.
